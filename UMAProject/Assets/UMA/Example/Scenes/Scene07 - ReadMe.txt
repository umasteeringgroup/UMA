The purpose of this Demo scene is to demonstrate one way of using UMA with multiplayer games.
I dont promise its the best or most efficient way, just an example on how it might look like.

Some things to note:
-You need to add the scenes to the player settings before playing.
-The current text based saving format is not ideal for networking since it takes up quite some space, 
 but making a better one is way out of scope for this Demo.
