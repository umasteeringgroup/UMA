What's new in 2.10 

Minimum supported version is 2018.4
Requires .Net 4.X compatibility in player settings. 

Important: In this version, the DynamicAssetLoader is only kept for compatiblity with old projects. To use Asset Bundles, you should either use Addressables, or manually download them and load them into the library.

Support for Addressables
  Automated generation of addressables groups (including LOD slots)
  Automated labelling of indexed items by recipe (including LOD slots)
  Automated cleanup of slots/overlays/textures
  Significantly reduced memory overhead
  Build requests are queued up with all relevant data
  Added recipes to Addressables. If you do this, you must load them before access (they are all labelled by recipe and with 'UMA_Recipe')
  Will now Keep shared group on regeneration. 
  Can now filter on non-added recipes.
  Can now individually choose to add a recipe to addressables, or to update a recipe. 
  Plugin system to customize how addressables are generated.

New global library window
  New functions to mark items by various parameters
  New Addressables Menu to generate items
  New Ability to remove unused slots/overlays using the addressable groups (Remove Orphans). Requires generating labels from recipes.
  New Ability to remove items from library by dropping a folder onto the lib
  Repair function will now attempt to repair addressable item groups and labels
  Can view if an item is in resources, or addressable now
  Protected resource items from being deleted as orphans
Added a label field to recipes to allow the user to override addressable label names
Moved Mesh  Hide mask creation to mesh building, to address sync issues
Updated DNA checks to pull from global library instead of searching resources. Fixes an issue on android
When the animator is rebuilt, the layer weights are saved and restored now
LoadFromRecipeString now has a flag to clear the existing wardrobe when loading
Added SetRawColor function (and code) so you can pass in an OverlayColorData and the sytem won't monkey with it
UMAMaterial Changes
   Added checkbox to use the overlay multiplier color as the background for alpha blended overlays. 
   Added a multiplier to allow adjusting that color. This improves the look of hair (gets rid of banding on the edges)
   Added a "Non Shader Texture" flag to the texture channels. This allows a texture to be combined, but it will not be set on the material.
   Added menu option to convert all UMAMaterials to use LWRP/URP material property names. you will still need to run the unity update utility in addition to this.
Added Animation Clip Target Renamer to help with renaming targets for UMAs when the animation is broken
Reworked compatible races recipe loading, so they are figured out in the index at startup
Context changes
    Created a new UMAGlobalContext context that pulls everything from the global library. 
    (This removes the need for the various libraries - racelibrary, slotlibrary, etc.)
    All access to UMA data now goes through the contexts.
    Created new prefab UMA_GLIB using the global context. It is recommended to switch to this version in 2.10.
LOD Improvements
    Added "Maximum LOD Level" to SlotDataAsset, and Suppressed flag to SlotData for use by LOD systems
    Added "Use Slot Dropping" to UMASimpleLOD, this will suppress slots based on the fields above.
    By default, the eyebrows, eyelashes, and Inner Mouth are set to drop after LOD 0. Eyes are set to drop after LOD 1.
Ability to hide slots by Slot tag.
Added support for 32 bit index buffers (large meshes). To enable, add UMA_32BITBUFFERS to the player defines. This is experimental at this time.
Verify button in Slot Builder Window will detect UV Coordinates that are out of range.
Added Elf male and Elf female races with base race recipes.
CollisionMatrixFixer will read the current layermask settings for Ragdoll and NoCollisions, and use those if found.
Added "AutoSetLayers" property to UMAPhysicsAvatar. When set, the player layer will be the current gameobject layer, and the Ragdoll layer will be read from the layermask settings.
Added Shader Parameter Mapping to UMAMaterial - UMAMaterials can now map shared colors to color properties in the generated material. Useful for shaders that have extra color parms (like skin & hair shaders).
Added "AtlasResolutionScale" to DynamicCharacterAvatar. Using this, you can lower the atlas resolution for specific avatars, for example ones used for icons, etc. Warning: UMASimpleLOD can override this, so don't use in conjunction with that component.
Added "Resources Only" flag to UMA recipes. Checking this will skip adding this recipe, and it's slots, overlays and textures to Addressabe groups.
New Menuitem on UMA Menu: "WebGL/Enable Embedded Resources". This will turn on embedded resources in WebGL, allowing UMA to work right in WebGL.
Overlay coordinates can now be specified in UV range (0..1) in addition to absolute range. This should make it much easier to handle Unity converting textures to square on mobile, or the need to resize textures for performance.
New Detail Normal map texture channel type, allows combining of normal maps in UMAMaterials (standard renderer only at this point)
New Non-Shader texture channel type, allows a texture to be accumulated on the atlas, but not sent to a material. 
The first RuntimeAnimatorController for compatible races will now be added if a race specific controller is not found.
You can now pass a constructed DynamicCharacterAvatar to the UMARandomAvatar.Randomize() function to regenerate it randomly.
New scene ("OverlayAligner") to convert and adjust overlay coordinates visually. 
Performance improvements - up to a 5% increase in speed when building under 2019.3 due to boneweight optimizations.
Added support for more than 32 wardrobe slots (problem with Masked Field editor)
Added DefaultRendererAsset property to DynamicCharacterAvatar. This lets you set "UpdateWhenOffscreen", the renderer name, etc, for the default renderer. If you don't add a DCA Renderer Manager, or setup a Renderer Asset for a slot, this one will be used to set renderer properties.
Standard Races now use mecanim-friendly avatars by default

New "How To" scenes
 * How to construct a DCA from scratch
 * How to construct and load a DCA from a prefab
 * How to load and save a DCA to a string
 * How to use a slider to control DNA

Various bug fixes & changes
    Fixed various overlays that were missing textures or had the wrong count
    Fixed some scenes that had broken over time
    Sometimes a shader would not be compiled correctly.
    Reworked recipe editor and disallowed duplicate mesh hide assets.
    Fixed bug where you couldn't add a Wardrobe Collection using SetSlot before Start() was called on the DCA.
    Fixed bug in 2019.3 where it was not finding the type for RuntimeAnimatorController in build.
    Fixed bug where WardrobeCollections would end up indexed in multiple places
    If you supply an avatar and animator from the project, it will no longer attempt to delete the avatar when changing the race
